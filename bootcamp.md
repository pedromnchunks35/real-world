# Day 1
- Learn part time and earning capital on full time
- Building habits 
- We should put all of our daily tasks on the daily tasks
# Day 2
- Reflect on the outcome
- Unexpected situations may lead to beeing unproductive
- Putting the daily tasks in a certain order and then just doing it
- Its better to do the every day tasks first and only then give your time for those that request it
- In the goal crusher we must put a achieable goal
- The goal should be in a 3 year frame
- Goal should be measurable
- Remember that sometimes we must do what we dont like for then making what we want
- You should not want dolares, you should want freedom
- Focus in what we must do to be free
- For example, we need 250k per year to satisfy our hobbi / freedom wish, so we should do x amount of money to spend x years to be free that x years
- Imagine what you would do with the money (travelling around the world,dating the hotest girls,spending time with your family,etc..)
  - Try to imagine something that is not material
# Day 3
# Day 4 time management
## Moods
- Try to have 2 moods
  - Creative mood (when not working)
    - When you plan what you should do
    - Try not to bring the phone
    - Think in how to solve problems
    - Think in business
    - Gather ideas
  - Work mood (working)
    - It is something more repetive
    - Be more like a robot
## Productivity
- Try to have a busy day so that way you install a urgency state to make things done
- We should try to fill or day with tasks oriented to our goals and let the unecessary tasks behind
# Day 5 correcting the long time goal
## Feedback
### Answer
- Beeing a profitable trader
### Feedback
- The goal is somewhat specific, but adding more details will help. Ensure you outline exactly what you want to achieve. Your goal is not measurable. Ensure you include specific numbers and targets to quantify your success. The goal seems unrealistic with the current plan. Detailed planning and clear steps are necessary for big goals. Your goal doesn't seem to be relevant. Why are you doing this? What is the purpose? Answer this, as it's the biggest thing to keep you going when times get tough. The goal lacks a defined timeframe. Setting a clear deadline is essential to track progress.
### Answer change
- I want to reach 90kg lean in 2 years and becoming a profitable trader such that i can do multiple compounding and do 1k in 1 year after the 3 year bootcamp. To achieve this i will train 2h per day every day and eat more than the required calories that my body needs to sustain himself +- 3000 kcal changing the body part that will have more enphasis every 1 month. Gaining the weigth will be easy, i need to go from 82 kg to 90, the problem then is to maintain the weigth and loose fat. In terms of the profitable trader part i will do atleast 1h of bootcamp every day and trying to make the most money possible in my job as possible and invest the most i can in the most basic and secure cryptocurrencies using the medium price strategy,planning to have more 15k (i can put like 1000-1500 euros per month or more because i expect to get a raise within those years)invested in terms of what i put it in and not the value itself with valorization or devaluerization. The plan is to follow along the bootcamp, knowing very well how to build systems, starting them by risking firstly 1 euro and then increasing my hand as the odds of sucess grow upper. Obs: I cannot put a timestamp in the bootcamp i just know that it takes 3 years if we spend atleast 1h per day. Part of the objetive is simply climbing up the ranks where the first takes 30 days and the rest depends of the task that i will be doing. The 1 euro risk takins should happen in the brown belt so i expect to becoming profitable to reach blackbelt and increase my hand so i can make 10% of lets say 10k per month by compounding 1k per month risking 1% of 10k it would be like 100 euros per trade and i would need to make like 15 trades per month, this depends of the type of system i will be bulding so it may be wrong to put it this way but i mean around 15 trades because i expect to know when to raise my hand.I have more objectives within this 3 years but those are the most specific and i think that the others may not fit to be here. The reason for achieving this objectives: freedom, making my parents proud and take care of those that i care about.
# Day 6
- No feedback yet, moving to day 7
- We already have feedback
- Weekly Planning Session: Every Sunday, plan your week. Write out your goals, your tasks, and when you'll do them. Goal Crushers is your new best friend. Keep it realistic. Keep it achievable. But get it done.

Pause Before You Act: Before making a decision, take a deep breath. Consider the implications. What could happen? What should happen? THINK before you act. View your actions the way a chess player does. 

MANDATORY: DELETE ALL EXCHANGE APPS FROM YOUR PHONE. Trade only on your computer. DON'T link your exchange account to TradingView. Do your charting separately. These steps will stop impulsive gambling. I know trading is not allowed at this stage of Bootcamp but I'll be honest, you're the most likely to fuck this up. I'm saving you from yourself here. Put barriers between you and bad decisions.
# Day 7

- Be smart with your money
- Dont spend money to impress others
- Its not cool to spend your money when you dont have it

- Learn to respect money
- You should trust that you will bring more money and beeing grateful for what you have
- Think how can your money be more spended
- You dont actually want money, you want to be free

- Think in how you can grow the money 10 times over
- Build yourself until you can simply create money from tiny air

- Ignore people that try to make you quit or think that your attitudes are wrong
- Dont give a shit about negative people
- For everything negative there is a positive thing, negativity is fuel to get something positive. Reverse it
# Day 8
- How wealth can accumulate
- Everything can accumulate in 3 ways: linear,exponential & Logarithmic Wealth
## Linear
- The increase is linear because it is constant
- It will get easily surpassed by the exponential mindset person
- Waggies
- Its a rat
## Exponential
- The increase is by % so it will increase in a non constant absolute way
- It will surpass the linear by far at a certain point
- Big curve moving
- To reach this we must start to thing in exponential toughts
- Its riskier as we grow because the more we have the more we can loose
## Logarithmic
- Same as exponential but it slows as we grow more and grow
- The first 100k change your life but the next 100k will not
- Why? Because the utility of the money
- First 100k will make you confortable with your bills but the next is more of the same because it does not have the same utility
- Having 1M dolars does not have meaning without a meaning because you must have a utility for it
- Its the best thought to maintain the wealth because if you go exponential you can loose a lot more since you have more
- After exponential is good to go Logarithmic because you will maintain the wealth
- It takes more time to achieve something but its more about maintaining and getting 1% better every single day 
## Abstract
- You go exponential in the beginning for the early stage and then go logarithmic
- Loose your linear mindset, go exponential and then go logarithmic (same as btc)
# Day 9
- Differences between a pro and a amateur
## Pro vs Amateur (RED PILL)
- You as pro want statistic proof that a system works
- a Pro has more than 100 trades or backtestings that proove that the system works

# Day 10
- Getting into the core lessons
- MetaLearning
  - How to learn better
## Metalearning

- Mike has a website to tell you how you are better at learning
- We must critical review where we were wrong and correct it/do better
- Study strategies/chats
- Put it in practise
- Live trading
- Try to share ideas in the white belt chat
- Teaching others
- Journalism
- You should understand how you get more info
```
1) Self-Assessment: 
Write out your strengths & weaknesses (in all areas of life, not just trading). Once you have done this you now have a list of skills you have and the areas you need to improve. 

2) Learning Styles Inventory: 
Take a questionnaire that shows you exactly how you learn best. You can then focus on the right learning style for you (video, audio, reading, practical).

3) Learn from Mistakes: 
Keep a database of your past trades, winners and losers, and then review them every day or week. This is ESSENTIAL for every trader.

4) Deliberate Practice: 
I will break down the lessons into specific applied practice, where you can test them out and reflect on the results. When I give you a task, DO THE WORK!

5) Peer Learning: 
Discuss the lessons and your trading journey with fellow students, using the -belt-lessons and -chat. Don't be shy, if you don't contribute you are missing a key opportunity to learn!

6) Journaling: 
Absolutely essential for every trader. You must maintain a trading journal, a simple google sheet is fine, where you document your backtesting, trades, outcomes, and keep a note of your thoughts, emotions and reasons for taking the trades. This will help you spot biases and flaws in your system, and over time MASSIVELY boost your Win Rate. I will show you how to do this when the time is right.

7) Teaching Others:
As a Bootcamp student, you are the best of the best inside TRW Trading Campus. I encourage you to help out those who are struggling, especially if you've been through the same issue as them. This will 100x your learning, and deepen your own mastery of trading.
```
- Results
  ```
  Strong Kinesthetic
  People with your preference like:
  practical exercises, experiences, examples, case studies, trial and error, things that are real,...
  strategies: https://vark-learn.com/strategies/kinesthetic-strategies/
  -> Take action
  -> Solve problems practically
  -> Recall experiences
  -> Real life examples
  -> Measure outcomes
  -> Team Work
  -> Using all of my senses
  -> Practise practise practise
  ```
💪 If you scored high on KINESTHETIC:
Practice Trading: Paper trade as you go through the lessons. This will allow you to practice your trading strategies in real-time market without risking actual money.

Role-Playing: Find a fellow student who's also a kinesthetic learner. You both can then talk about hypothetical trading scenarios and discuss potential strategies and outcomes.

Teach Others: Explaining what you've learned to someone else or discussing it will help you understand it more deeply.
# Day 11
- The teacher recommends us to use trading view
- Its a class from the classes that we already had
- We are making revision
- CRL+R to center the chart
- We can use `Paper trading` which is something that we have in the trading panel for us to work with fake money
# Day 12
- Accumulations & Distribution
# Day 13
- Trend following and Mean revision
- Pay attention to the trend because there must only be a trend change when there is a full pullback in the candle instead of staying in the upper or the downest place (ex: trend upwards, it stops going up but does not retrace until the minimum of the upward cadle.. that means it will go upward)
- Ranges is where we spend more time
- Try to do trading in ranges
# Day 14
- waves
- Trend following
- ranges
# Day 15
- Market laws
- Wyckoff Theory and Dow Theory
- Supply & demand only stops price (limit orders)
- Supply & demand are passive , buyers and sellers are aggressive
- Having lack of supply, price increases
- Having lack of demand, price decreases
## How to measure supply & demand
- Low timeframe (minutes) = order flow & harmonic divergence matrix
- Mid timeframe (hours/days) = Harmonic divergence matrix (third law effort vs result, a indicator created by the teacher)
- High timeframe (weeks/months) = Price action structures (market structures)
# DAY 16
- Law of cause and effect
  - Acumulation/Distribution = Cause
  - Uptrend/Downtrend = Effect
  - Smart Money and Dumb money
  - Causes are constructed by Smart money
- Macro events are causes that can bring effects
  - Think how causes may influence the project
  - If that is relevant
  - You cannot thing right away that a event is good or bad (ex: release of a new update)
- Harmony and Divergence
# Day 17
- Mandatory test
# Day 18
- Speaking about the habits and about the system built that we dont require to be profitable
- What we need
  - Price
  - Volume
  - Than we can do it hehe
- Just build systems that spot harmony and divergence
  - Trend traders use harmony
  - Reverse traders use divergence
- Trade break outs or mean reverses
  - Breakout
    - It breaks out a swing high or swing low
  - Mean reverse
    - Identify a prob extreme range and trade against it
# Day 19
- Systems and how to build them
## Core Requirements of a System
1. Trade Type
2. Risk Management
3. When to Enter
4. When to Exit
## Trade types
- Breakout
  - Price reaches high or low
  - Price beaks and hold above or below this level with confirmation
  - You enter long or short based on the system
- Mean Reversion
  - Find prob range
  - Wait price to find extreme
  - Confirm high prob range
  - Long or Short in the direction of reversal
## Important
