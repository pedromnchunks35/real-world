# Day 1
- Learn part time and earning capital on full time
- Building habits 
- We should put all of our daily tasks on the daily tasks
# Day 2
- Reflect on the outcome
- Unexpected situations may lead to beeing unproductive
- Putting the daily tasks in a certain order and then just doing it
- Its better to do the every day tasks first and only then give your time for those that request it
- In the goal crusher we must put a achieable goal
- The goal should be in a 3 year frame
- Goal should be measurable
- Remember that sometimes we must do what we dont like for then making what we want
- You should not want dolares, you should want freedom
- Focus in what we must do to be free
- For example, we need 250k per year to satisfy our hobbi / freedom wish, so we should do x amount of money to spend x years to be free that x years
- Imagine what you would do with the money (travelling around the world,dating the hotest girls,spending time with your family,etc..)
  - Try to imagine something that is not material
