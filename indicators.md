# CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta)
- Indicator for identifying buying and selling pressure in the market
- Delta = Difference
- Positive = Buying pressure
- Negative = Selling pressure
- Buyers & sellers = market orders (agression)
- When agression does not match price, take note
- Best on low timeframe (4hr or lower) and with fixed lookback period
- We can use it to spot divergences because we can see the CVD lowering when prices are upwards for example
- `coinalyze.net` to see the CVD (we should make sure that it analyzes the same lookback (number of candles))

- In this case there is high CVD but as you can see the price does not go up which means there is a divergence
- There is likely a big resistance in that area
- In this case we should go short
